# Data Analyst Nanodegree


The repository contains projects for Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). 

This nanodegree focuses on Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, A/B Hypothesis Testing, and Regression analysis.

### Part 1: Investigate a Dataset -Introduction to Data Analysis
Learning the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Working with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.


##### Project - Investigate a Dataset

Choosing one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigating it using NumPy and Pandas. Going through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

### Part 2: Practical Statistics

 Applying inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.

##### Project - Analyze A/B Test Results

Analyzing the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to decide whether the company should implement new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to increase user conversion rate.

### Part 3: Data Visualization

Applying visualization principles to the data analysis process. Exploring data visually at multiple levels to find insights and creating a compelling story.

##### Project - Communicate Data Findings

Using Pythonâ€™s data visualization tools to systematically explore a selected dataset for its properties and relationships between variables.Then creating a presentation that communicates the findings to others.
